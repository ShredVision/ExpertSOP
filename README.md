# Expert SOP

#### New Clients:
* You'll get a (text) message when a new job is available, please reply to claim.
* Please claim within 1h or by 6PM (whichever is later), the client will be reassigned otherwise. Exception: any job received after 9PM is claimable until noon the next day.
* Please provide your feedback within 24h of our initial message.

#### Initial Analysis:
* Don't feel the need to limit your analysis only to the specific area your client wants to improve in.
* Watch the raw clip to identify instructable moments.

#### Recording Your Advice:
* "Record" will capture the screen, your voice, and annotations.
* Let the client know what they are doing well.
* Voiceover advice during instructable moments (skip around as needed).
* Draw on paused frames to show what the client is doing vs what they should try to do.
* Optional: use the camera feature for demonstrations.
* The more specific, actionable & attainable the feedback, the better (remember to include the "why"). Set tangible goals & suggest exercises as needed.
* Just be you. The final thing needn't be polished. Suggested duration = few min.
